# SeniorProject
Continuation of a game [Craig Williams](https://github.com/craigwilliams9992) and I began as a part of a larger group in an AI for computer games class at UF. We decided to continue our work on the game as our senior project under the guidance of our professor.

## Maro Fortuna

Maro Fortuna is a strategy adventure game styled like a choose-your-own-adventure novel. The player acts as the captain of his animal crew, navigating the waters of a new planet to find islands and selecting which of his crew members to send on missions in order to gather resources to found a new settlement. Once a number of days have passed if the player has gathered enough resources from successfully completing missions the game ends with a civilization reflecting one of the four mission types being founded (Science, Military, Espionage, Diplomacy).
